# Tour of Heroes full-stack application

A little project using the Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial as a starting point.

## Tech stack so far

~~The backend consists of ASP.NET 8 Web API Entity Framework Core~~(todo) while the frontend is written in Angular 17.

## Frontend shenanigans

- Standalone components
- Consistent use of `inject()` instead of stuffing the constructor
